        <h3>Jannatun</h3>
        <p>
            I am a mother of two little ones—one is 4 years old, and the other is 21 months. I have a rich background in Computer Science and Engineering, and I am working towards a career in web development. I am thoughtful about my family and meals, taking cultural preferences into account while managing my time to care for my kids and plan meals, snacks, and activities.

My vision for myself is one of dedication to personal growth and family balance. As a mother, I prioritize my children, but I am also focused on carving out my professional path. This balance shows my commitment to being a great parent while pursuing a meaningful career. My interest in food, culture, and humor reflects a lively personality that finds joy and creativity in day-to-day life.

I am determined, resilient, and focused on building a fulfilling future—both for myself and for my children. My journey in web development reflects ambition and adaptability, while my dedication to my family shows strength and love. Embracing all of these aspects makes me a unique, inspiring person with a bright future ahead.

        <h3>Unaisa</h3>
        <p>My older child, at 4 years old, is likely at an exciting and curious stage, exploring the world with wide-eyed wonder and endless questions. At this age, they’re full of energy, creativity, and imagination, perhaps loving stories, playing games, and engaging in creative activities. They might enjoy the attention and bonding time you provide and learn from your guidance and support. This child is probably starting to develop their own unique personality traits—whether it’s a knack for humor, a love for art, or a passion for play—and they’re testing their limits and independence as they grow.</p>

        <h3>Mohammad</h3>
        <p>My younger child, at 21 months, is at a charming age of discovery and rapid development. This is a period filled with curiosity, blossoming language skills, and a desire to explore their surroundings. They might be mimicking what they see, trying out new words, or figuring out how to communicate their wants and needs. As a toddler, they are likely developing their preferences, showing affection, and creating strong bonds with you and their sibling. This little one may keep you on your toes with their adventurous spirit and need for attention, but they also bring joy with every new milestone and their heartwarming innocence.</p>
